# React + TypeScript + Vite

This project is built using React, TypeScript, and Vite to create a responsive, modern web application. The application is supported by a JSON Server as a mock backend.
git clone https://github.com/kaltrinabaliu/reactjs-interview-task.git
cd reactjs-interview-task



Run the server side: Ensure json-server is installed globally or locally in your project.

json-server --watch db.json




To run this app

npm i

npm run dev




How might you make this app more secure?
To enhance the security of this app, consider the following strategies:

Sanitize and Validate Input:

Ensure that all user input is properly sanitized to prevent injection attacks such as XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) and SQL Injection (if a real database is used).
Implement Authentication and Authorization:

Use token-based authentication (e.g., JWT).
Implement role-based access control to restrict access to certain routes and features.
Secure API Endpoints:

If connecting to an external API or a backend, use HTTPS for secure data transmission.
Add rate-limiting and IP whitelisting to prevent DDoS (Distributed Denial-of-Service) attacks.
CORS Configuration:

Configure CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) rules properly to limit which domains can access the backend server.

Use tools like helmet (for Node.js) to set various HTTP headers to help protect the app (e.g., X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options).



How would you make this solution scale to millions of records?
To handle scaling efficiently, consider these architectural and code optimization techniques:

Database Optimization:

Use a robust database system like MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or MySQL, optimized for large datasets.
Implement database sharding and indexing for faster querying.
Use pagination or infinite scrolling to avoid loading all records at once.
Caching Strategies:

Backend Improvements:

Introduce load balancing to distribute traffic across multiple servers.
Deploy the backend using cloud services with auto-scaling capabilities, such as AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Azure App Service, or Google Cloud Platform.
Efficient Data Transfer:

Use GraphQL or optimized REST API calls to only fetch required data, reducing the payload size.
Compress server responses using Gzip or Brotli.
Asynchronous Processing:

Offload heavy operations to background workers or task queues (e.g., Bull, RabbitMQ, or Celery) to keep the app responsive.
Microservices Architecture:

Use techniques like code splitting and lazy loading to improve initial load times.
Optimize asset delivery through CDNs (Content Delivery Networks).
